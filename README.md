Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
- What REST means
- What API means
- What CORS means
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are other type of APIs
- Which is the HTTP method to retrieve resource(s)
- Which is the HTTP method to create a resource
- Which is the HTTP method to update resource
- Which is the HTTP method to delete resource
- How to request REST API

Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

Requirements

Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

Python Unit Tests
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases

GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

Tasks

0. Restart from scratch!

No no no! We are already too far in the project to restart everything.

But once again, let’s work on a new codebase.

For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3



1. Never fail!

Since the beginning we’ve been using the unittest module, but do you know why unittests are so important? Because when you add a new feature, you refactor a piece of code, etc… you want to be sure you didn’t break anything.

At Holberton, we have a lot of tests, and they all pass! Just for the Intranet itself, there are:

- 5,213 assertions (as of 08/20/2018)
- 13,061 assertions (as of 01/25/2021)

The following requirements must be met for your project:

- all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
- add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 | tail -1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK

2. Improve storage

Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:

- Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
  - cls: class
  - id: string representing the object ID
- Returns the object based on the class and its ID, or None if not found

A method to count the number of objects in storage:

- Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
  - cls: class (optional)
- Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class. If no class is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.

Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ cat test_get_count.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test .get() and .count() methods
"""
from models import storage
from models.state import State

print("All objects: {}".format(storage.count()))
print("State objects: {}".format(storage.count(State)))

first_state_id = list(storage.all(State).values())[0].id
print("First state: {}".format(storage.get(State, first_state_id)))
